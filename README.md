# Install script for Davinci Resolve for Ubuntu

We, as an animation studio (storytailors.nl), work entirely on Ubuntu Linux. 
We love the desktop experience and the open nature of the open source community. 
Therefore, we share our code and methods with others who also want to use Linux for business purposes.

This code installs Blackmagic Resolve, Fusion, and the Fusion network renderer on Ubuntu.

## Tested versions
Resolve          : Studio 18.6.4
Fusion           : Studio 18.6.4
Fusion Renderer  : Studio 18.6.4

Ubuntu           : 23.04, 23.10
